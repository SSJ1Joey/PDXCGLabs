            Jake the dog is a magical dog and veteran adventurer who lives in the land of Oo with his adopted brother Finn the human. Known for his high score in Kompy's Kastle (which he plays every day to maintain his rank) and for his skill with the viola. Jake has 5 children with Lady Rainicorn who are about the same age as him...maybe even older now. He can stretch into any shape and big or small. Jake is not cute he will mess you up.
